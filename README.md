This repository contains the research and implementation related to the paper "Designing Knowledge-Based Potentials via B-Spline Basis Functions for Native Proteins Detection" by Elmira Mirzabeigi, Saeed Mortezazadeh, Rezvan Salehi, and Hossein Naderi-Manesh.

## Overview

This project focuses on developing knowledge-based potentials to differentiate native protein structures from decoy sets. Two distance-dependent potential energy functions were constructed using B-spline basis functions, optimized through a linear programming approach. The paper proposes two methods based on different assumptions for energy calculations to improve native structure detection accuracy.

The study explores the following key points:
1. **Protein Structure Prediction**: Utilizing Anfinsen's dogma for structure prediction.
2. **Knowledge-Based Potentials**: Extracting potential functions based on pairwise distances between CÎ± atoms in proteins.
3. **B-Spline Basis Functions**: Using B-spline basis functions to represent potential functions at various distances between amino acids.
4. **Optimization Schemes**: Implementing two optimization schemes using MATLAB to minimize error in detecting native structures from decoys.

## Key Features

- **Linear Programming Knowledge-Based Potentials (LPKP)**: Optimized potentials using linear programming to differentiate native and decoy structures.
- **B-Spline Representation**: The potentials are expressed using eight uniform cubic B-spline basis functions.
- **Data**: The dataset for training and testing the model consists of Titan-HRD decoy sets, available at [Titan-HRD](http://titan.princeton.edu/HRDecoys).

## Results

- **LPKP1**: Correctly identified 130 out of 150 native structures with an average rank of 1.67.
- **LPKP2**: Correctly identified 124 out of 150 native structures with an average rank of 2.83.

Both methods demonstrated promising results in accurately detecting native protein structures from an ensemble of decoys.
